Hi, I'm Zhaofan! I'm a last-year Master student in the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City at University of Macau, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.pengyangwang.com/home">Pengyang Wang</a>. I was lucky enough to receive a PhD offer from HKUST(GZ). Will be working under the joint guidance of Prof. <a href="https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=253">Hui Xiong</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sihongxie.github.io/">Sihong Xie</a>.
